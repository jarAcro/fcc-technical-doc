  <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a versatile, object-oriented scripting language that works on various platforms. It's known for its small and lightweight nature. When used within a host environment, like a web browser, JavaScript can interact with the objects in that environment to provide control and interactivity.</p>
  <p>JavaScript comes with a standard library of objects such as Array, Date, and Math, along with a core set of language features like operators, control structures, and statements. These core JavaScript capabilities can be expanded for different purposes by adding more objects. For instance:</p>
  <ul>
<li>Client-side JavaScript enhances the core language to control a web browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). This allows applications to manipulate HTML forms, respond to user actions like clicks and input, and handle page navigation.</li>

<li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language to perform tasks relevant to server-side programming. It enables communication with databases, data continuity between application invocations, and file operations on a server.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>While JavaScript and Java share some similarities, they are fundamentally different in many ways. JavaScript has some resemblances to Java but lacks Java's static typing and strong type checking. It follows similar expression syntax, naming conventions, and basic control-flow constructs, which led to its name change from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

<p>In contrast to Java's compile-time class system, JavaScript uses a runtime system with a small set of data types, including numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript utilizes a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based model. This means it supports dynamic inheritance, where inherited properties can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also allows functions without specific declarative requirements and treats them as loosely typed methods.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
  <header id="Hello_world">Hello World</header>
  <p>To begin coding in JavaScript, you can use the Scratchpad and write a simple "Hello world" script. Here's an example:</p>
  <code id="greet_code">function greetMe(yourName) {
  alert("Hello " + yourName);
}
greetMe("World");
</code>
<p>To declare a function in Javascript, use the <em>key</em> word "function":</p>
<code>function(Here are arguments){<br>
Contents of function goes here.
};
</code>
<p>To declare variables in javascript:<p>
  <code>let a = 5; <br>
    let b = "Hello";
  </code>
  <p>The semicolon at the end of each line tells the compiler that this is the end of the line of code.</p>
  <code>let a = 5<em>;</em><---- Semicolon signifying the end</code>
  <p>Math in javascript is easy using the symbols ?*-+:</p>
<code>let a = 5;<br>
  let b = 5;<br>
  let sum = a + b;
</code>

<section class="main-section" id="Variables">
  <header id="Variables">Variables</header>
  <p>In JavaScript, you use variables as symbolic names for values in your applications. Variables, known as identifiers, must adhere to certain rules:</p>
  <ul>
<li>An identifier in JavaScript must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Following characters can include digits (0-9).</li>
<li>JavaScript is case-sensitive, so it recognizes both uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters.</li>
<li>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters like å and ü in identifiers, as well as Unicode escape sequences. Examples of valid identifiers include Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</li>
  </ul>
